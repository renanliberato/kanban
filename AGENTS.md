This file captures tribal knowledge-the nuanced, non-obvious patterns that make the difference between a quick fix and hours of debugging.
When to add to this file:
- User had to intervene, correct, or hand-hold
- Multiple back-and-forth attempts were needed to get something working
- You discovered something that required reading many files to understand
- A change touched files you wouldn't have guessed
- Something worked differently than you expected
- User explicitly asks to add something
Proactively suggest additions when any of the above happen-don't wait to be asked.
What NOT to add: Stuff you can figure out from reading a few files, obvious patterns, or standard practices. This file should be high-signal, not comprehensive.

TypeScript principles
- No any types unless absolutely necessary.
- Check node_modules for external API type definitions instead of guessing.
- Prefer SDK-provided types, schemas, helpers, and model metadata over local redefinitions. For things like Cline SDK reasoning settings, use the SDK's source of truth whenever possible instead of recreating unions, support checks, or shapes in Kanban.
- NEVER use inline imports. No await import("./foo.js"), no import("pkg").Type in type positions, and no dynamic imports for types. Always use standard top-level imports.
- NEVER remove or downgrade code to fix type errors from outdated dependencies. Upgrade the dependency instead.

Code quality
- Write production-quality code, not prototypes
- Break components into small, single-responsibility files. 
- Extract shared logic into hooks and utilities. 
- Prioritize maintainability and clean architecture over speed. 
- Follow DRY principles and maintain clean architecture with clear separation of concerns.
- In `web-ui`, prefer `react-use` hooks (via `@/kanban/utils/react-use`) whenever possible
- Before adding custom utility code, evaluate whether a well-maintained third-party package can reduce complexity and long-term maintenance cost.

Architecture opinions
- Avoid thin shell wrappers that only forward props or relocate JSX for a single call site.
- Prefer extracting domain logic (state, effects, async orchestration) over presentation-only pass-through layers.
- Do not optimize for line count alone. Optimize for codebase navigability and clarity.

Git guardrails
- NEVER commit unless user asks.

GitHub issues
When reading issues:
- Always read all comments on the issue.
- Use this command to get everything in one call:
  gh issue view <number> --json title,body,comments,labels,state

When closing issues via commit:
- Include fixes #<number> or closes #<number> in the commit message. This automatically closes the issue when the commit is merged.

web-ui Stack
- Kanban web-ui uses Tailwind CSS v4 for styling, Radix UI for accessible headless primitives, and Lucide React for icons.
- Custom UI primitives live in `src/components/ui/` (button, dialog, tooltip, kbd, spinner, cn utility).
- Toast notifications use `sonner`. Import `{ toast }` from `"sonner"` or use `showAppToast` from `@/components/app-toaster`.

Styling mental model
- Use Tailwind utility classes as the primary styling system. Prefer `className` over inline `style={{}}`.
- Prefer Tailwind classes over adding custom CSS in `globals.css` when possible. Conditional Tailwind classes via `cn()` are better than CSS overrides for state-driven styling (e.g. selected/active variants). Reserve `globals.css` for things Tailwind can't express: complex selectors (sibling combinators, attribute selectors), app-level layout glue, or styles that genuinely need to cascade.
- Only use inline `style={{}}` for truly dynamic values (colors from props/variables, computed positions from drag-and-drop, runtime-dependent dimensions).
- The design system tokens are defined in `globals.css` inside `@theme { ... }`. Use Tailwind utilities that reference them: `bg-surface-0`, `text-text-primary`, `border-border`, etc.

Design tokens (defined in globals.css @theme)
- Surface hierarchy: `surface-0` (#1F2428, app bg / columns), `surface-1` (#24292E, navbar / project col / raised), `surface-2` (#2D3339, cards/inputs), `surface-3` (#353C43, hover), `surface-4` (#3E464E, pressed/scrollbars)
- Borders: `border` (#30363D, default), `border-bright` (#444C56, more visible), `border-focus` (#0084FF, focus rings)
- Text: `text-primary` (#E6EDF3), `text-secondary` (#8B949E), `text-tertiary` (#6E7681)
- Accent: `accent` (#0084FF), `accent-hover` (#339DFF)
- Status: `status-blue` (#4C9AFF), `status-green` (#3FB950), `status-orange` (#D29922), `status-red` (#F85149), `status-purple` (#A371F7), `status-gold` (#D4A72C)
- Border radius: `rounded-sm` (4px), `rounded-md` (6px), `rounded-lg` (8px), `rounded-xl` (12px)

UI primitives (src/components/ui/)
- `Button` from `@/components/ui/button`: `variant="default"|"primary"|"danger"|"ghost"`, `size="sm"|"md"`, `icon={<LucideIcon />}`, `fill`, children for text content.
- `Dialog`, `DialogHeader`, `DialogBody`, `DialogFooter` from `@/components/ui/dialog`: For modals. `DialogHeader` takes a `title` string.
- `AlertDialog`, `AlertDialogTitle`, `AlertDialogDescription`, `AlertDialogAction`, `AlertDialogCancel` from `@/components/ui/dialog`: For destructive confirmations.
- `Tooltip` from `@/components/ui/tooltip`: `<Tooltip content="text"><trigger/></Tooltip>`.
- `Spinner` from `@/components/ui/spinner`: `size` (number), `className`.
- `Kbd` from `@/components/ui/kbd`: Keyboard shortcut display.
- `cn` from `@/components/ui/cn`: Utility for conditional className joining.

Icons
- Use `lucide-react` for all icons. Import individual icons: `import { Settings, Plus, Play } from "lucide-react"`.
- Standard icon sizes: 14px for small buttons, 16px for default contexts.
- Pass icons as JSX elements to button `icon` prop: `icon={<Settings size={16} />}`.

Radix UI primitives
- Use Radix directly for headless behavior: `@radix-ui/react-popover`, `@radix-ui/react-dropdown-menu`, `@radix-ui/react-checkbox`, `@radix-ui/react-switch`, `@radix-ui/react-collapsible`, `@radix-ui/react-select`.
- Style Radix components with Tailwind classes. Use `data-[state=checked]:` for state-driven styling.

Dark theme
- The app is always in dark theme. Colors are set via CSS custom properties in `globals.css`.
- Surface hierarchy: `bg-surface-0` (app background) -> `bg-surface-1` (raised panels) -> `bg-surface-2` (cards/inputs) -> `bg-surface-3` (hover) -> `bg-surface-4` (pressed).
- Do NOT use Blueprint, Tailwind's light-mode defaults, or any `dark:` prefix. The theme is always dark.

Misc. tribal knowledge
- Kanban's native Cline agent is powered by the installed `@clinebot/core`, `@clinebot/agents`, and `@clinebot/llms` packages plus the local `src/cline-sdk/` boundary layer, so when Cline behavior is unclear, inspect those packages and `src/cline-sdk/` for the real implementation details.
- Kanban is launched from the user's shell and inherits its environment. For agent detection and task-agent startup, prefer direct PATH checks and direct process launches over spawning an interactive shell. Avoid `zsh -i`, shell fallback command discovery, or "launch shell then type command into it" on hot paths. On setups with heavy shell init like `conda` or `nvm`, doing that per task can freeze the runtime and even make new Terminal.app windows feel hung when several tasks start at once. It's fine to use an actual interactive shell for explicit shell terminals, not for normal agent session work.
- If CI hangs on Node 22 after tests seem to finish, suspect a live subprocess or SDK-host startup path before assuming a slow test body. Read `.plan/docs/node22-ci-hanging-tests-investigation.md` before repeating that investigation. `test/runtime/cline-sdk/cline-task-session-service.test.ts` was the big prior culprit because a unit-style suite was still booting the real Cline SDK host.
- When Kanban runs on a headless remote Linux instance (for example over SSH+tunnel), native folder picker commands may be unavailable (`zenity`/`kdialog`). Treat this as a normal remote-runtime limitation and use manual path entry fallback instead of requiring desktop packages.
- Adding a new board column with automatic prompts and gates touches more files than it first appears. The minimum pass usually spans:
  - shared column enums/order and normalization: `src/core/api-contract.ts`, `src/state/workspace-state.ts`, `web-ui/src/data/board-data.ts`, `web-ui/src/state/board-state.ts`
  - drag/order/detail-view affordances: `web-ui/src/state/drag-rules.ts`, `web-ui/src/utils/detail-view-task-order.ts`, `web-ui/src/components/kanban-board.tsx`, `web-ui/src/components/dependencies/dependency-overlay.tsx`, `web-ui/src/components/board-card.tsx`, `web-ui/src/components/card-detail-view.tsx`
  - project counts and CLI/runtime surfaces: `src/server/workspace-registry.ts`, `web-ui/src/hooks/app-utils.tsx`, `web-ui/src/components/project-navigation-panel.tsx`, `src/commands/task.ts`
  - settings/config plumbing for prompt templates: `src/config/runtime-config.ts`, `src/terminal/agent-registry.ts`, `web-ui/src/runtime/use-runtime-config.ts`, `web-ui/src/App.tsx`, `web-ui/src/components/runtime-settings-dialog.tsx`
  - automation state machine and tests: `web-ui/src/hooks/use-board-interactions.ts`, `web-ui/src/hooks/use-board-interactions.test.tsx`
- For gated automation columns, keep the stage contract explicit:
  - each gate column needs a prompt template, a failure follow-up template, and fixed pass/fail sentinel strings in the final assistant message
  - the automation hook should only advance on explicit pass signals and only bounce back on explicit failure signals; never treat a generic `awaiting_review` completion as success
  - if a stage failure routes the task back to `in_progress`, queue the corrective follow-up prompt separately from the “failure already handled” state so retries do not get suppressed
- In `web-ui/src/hooks/use-board-interactions.ts`, never call `tryProgrammaticCardMove()` from inside a `setBoard(...)` updater. That triggers React render-phase update warnings with DnD/`flushSync`. Compute transitions in the effect body, then call `setBoard(nextBoard)` after the loop.
- Stage automation depends on the card actually landing in the next column. The automation effect must depend on `board`, not only `sessions`, and prompt-send logic should key off “entered stage version” refs so the prompt fires after the card is in the stage.
- Use separate refs per gated stage for:
  - the session version when the task entered the stage
  - the session version whose stage prompt has already been sent
  - the session version whose failure has already been handled
  - the session version whose failure follow-up prompt has already been sent
- Automated prompts should be sent as `paste` followed by an explicit `"\r"` submit, with a few short retries. Pasting alone is not enough for these stage transitions.
- When adding a new gated column, extend the focused automation tests before trusting the UI manually. At minimum, cover:
  - entry into the stage sends the stage prompt
  - no progress without a new post-stage completion event
  - no progress without an explicit pass signal
  - failure signal routes back and sends the failure prompt
  - pass signal advances to the next column
- After adding a new column, expect supporting test fixtures that hardcode counts or column arrays to fail typecheck until they include the new column, especially project/task-count tests and small hook harness board builders.
